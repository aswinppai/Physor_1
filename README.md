Project Description: 
  Physor 1 is an inventory management system designed to help warehouse owners and sellers efficiently track and manage stock levels, supplier details, and item 
  quantities using a MySQL database. With a simple Python interface, users can add, view, update, and delete records effortlessly, making inventory control easier 
  and more organized.

The Problem : 
  Have you ever found yourself overwhelmed by stacks of paperwork, endless spreadsheets, and the eternal question, "Do I have enough widgets in stock?" Managing 
  inventory can be tedious and time-consuming, especially for those who prefer a little more fun in life. Physor 1 is here to solve that problem...even if you didn’t 
  know you had it.

The Solution:
  Introducing Physor 1, the Python-powered, MySQL-connected inventory superhero you never knew you needed! With just a few clicks, Physor 1 keeps tabs on every 
  widget, gadget, and doodad in your warehouse, tracks suppliers, and prevents stock-outs—so you can focus on the important things, like figuring out what a doodad 
  actually is.
